# Assignment2

This is my android project. It was an assignment but i ended up adding my functionality and improving the application.

Application Functionality.

Networking : Fetching data from an API and returning the data to MainActivity using a callback interface.
RecyclerView (Scrolling view) feature to display objects to user in a clean interactive UI using customAdapter and viewHolder to implement this.
JSONManager, converting fetched data into JSON objects to initialize Car and return a list of fetched cars to MainActivity.
RoomDatabase to create a database and perform CRUD operations when required.
